The `useServerAction()` hook makes calling a SafeFn from the client easy.
It handles transitioning, exposes loading states and converts the `Promise<ActionResult>` object back into a `ResultAsync`.

```ts title="server/... .ts"
const mySafeFn = SafeFn.new().handler(() => {
  return ok("Success");
});
```

```ts title="server/... .ts"
const myAction = mySafeFn.createAction();
```

```tsx title="client/... .tsx"
const { execute, result, isPending, isSuccess } = useServerAction(
  action,
  callbacks,
);
```

## Arguments

### SafeFn Action

The `action` argument is the resulting function from calling `createAction()` on a SafeFn.

### Callbacks

The `useServerAction()` hook optionally takes in the following callbacks functions that will run on the client, and the properties of the argument object they can take:

- `onStart()` - Called when `execute()` is called.
  - `unsafeRawInput`: The raw input passed into `execute()`.
- `onSuccess()` - Called when the `execute()` returns an `Ok`.
  - `unsafeRawInput`: The raw input passed into `execute()`.
  - `value`: The value returned from the action. [See here for the type](/docs/run/return-type).
- `onError()` - Called when the `execute()` returns an `Err`.
  - `unsafeRawInput`: The raw input passed into `execute()`.
  - `error`: the error returned from the action. [See here for the type](/docs/run/return-type).
- `onComplete()` - Called when the `execute()` returns.
  - `unsafeRawInput`: The raw input passed into `execute()`.
  - `result`: The result returned from the action. [See here for the type](/docs/run/return-type).

<Callout type="info">
  These callbacks are not awaited. This means `onStart()` does not block the
  action from running, and the other callbacks do not block hook from returning
  the result from the action.
</Callout>

{/* Explain impacts of redirecting on callbacks */}

## Returns

An object with the following properties:

- `execute()`: A function that takes in the argument to run the action, the same as the argument for `run()`.
- `result`: the `Result` of running `execute()`. See [the dedicated page](/docs/run/return-type) for the type of this.
- `isPending`: a boolean representing if the action is currently executing or transitioning.
- `isSuccess`: a boolean representing if the action completed successfully.
