title: Directly
---

You can run a SafeFn directly by using the `run()` method. This will execute the SafeFn, returning a `ResultAsync` and is intended to be used on the server.

```ts
const mySafeFn = SafeFn.new().handler(() => {
  return ok("Success");
});

const res = mySafeFn.run();
//   ^? ResultAsync<"Success", { code: "UNCAUGHT_ERROR", ... }>
```

The arguments required is the `unparsedInput` of the SafeFn. This is either inferred from the input schema, or passed via `unparsedInput<T>()`.

```ts
const mySafeFn = SafeFn.new()
  .input(z.object({ name: z.string() }))
  .handler((args) => {
    return ok(`Hello, ${args.unparsedInput.name}!`);
  });

const res = mySafeFn.run({ firstName: "World" });
// Error:'firstName' does not exist in type '{ name: string; }' [!code highlight]
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you're intending to call the function from the client, such as via a server
  action or through an API route, it's recommended to use the
  [`createAction()`](/docs/run/action) method.
