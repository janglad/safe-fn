title: As an action
---

When you're intending to call the SafeFn from the client, such as via a server action or through an API route, you can use the `createAction()` method.
This returns a function that returns an `ActionResult`. This is done as NeverThrow's `Result` type cannot be serialized and sent to the client.
{/* TODO: link to docs about this */}
When using the [`useServerAction()` hook from `safe-fn-react`](/docs/run/hook), this is automatically converted back to a `ResultAsync` for you.

```ts
const mySafeFn = SafeFn.new().handler(() => {
  return ok("Success");
});

const action = mySafeFn.createAction();
```

The required argument is either the input type of the input schema if you defined one, or the type set through `.unparsedInput<T>()`. This is merged that of the parent SafeFn if there is one.

```ts
const mySafeFn = SafeFn.new()
  .input(z.object({ name: z.string() }))
  .handler((args) => {
    return ok(`Hello, ${args.unparsedInput.name}!`);
  });

const res = mySafeFn.createAction()({ firstName: "World" });
// Error:'firstName' does not exist in type '{ name: string; }' [!code highlight]
```

## Return type

See [the dedicated page](/docs/run/return-type) for the return type of `createAction()`.
