## Instantiating

{/* TODO: chaining page */}
You can create a SafeFn by using the `.new()` method. Here you can optionally pass in a parent handler (see chaining)

```ts
import { parentFunction } from "./some-file";

const myySafeFunction = SafeFn.new();
const mySafeFunction2 = SafeFn.new(parentFunction);
```
