You can create procedure chains by using `.use()`. This is a function that takes in a SafeFn.

```ts
const authedFn = createSafeFn()
  .safeHandler(async () => {
    const user = await getUser();
    if (!user) {
      return err({
        code: "UNAUTHORIZED",
      });
      return user;
    }
  })
  .catch((e) => ({
    code: "AUTH_ERROR",
    cause: e,
  }));

const getUserTodos = createSafeFn().use(authedFn). ...
```

This parent SafeFn will run before the child it's defined on (including all callbacks). If it returns an `Err`, the function is short circuited and input parsing/the handler on the child will not be executed. As such, the return type of the child safe-fn now includes the possible `Err` values of the parent.

Setting a parent SafeFn also changes the available arguments for [handler](/docs/create/handler) and [callback](/docs/create/callbacks) functions, as outlined on their pages.
