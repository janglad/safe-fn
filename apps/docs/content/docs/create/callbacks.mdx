title: Callback functions
---

<Callout type="info">
  While these functions are guaranteed to finish execution before your function
  returns (to prevent issues in serverless environments) and will be called in
  their logical order (`onStart` -> `onSuccess` | `onError` -> `onComplete`),
  they are not guaranteed to finish execution in that order (e.g., `onComplete`
  can finish execution before `onStart` if `onStart` makes a long async
  request).
</Callout>
<Callout type="info">
    These functions must return `Promise<void>`. All thrown errors are automatically caught, except for framework related ones like Next's `Redirect`.
</Callout>

The examples bellow use the following SafeFn

```ts
const parent = SafeFn.new()
  .input(z.object({ firstName: z.string(), lastName: z.string() }))
  .handler((args) => {
    return ok(`${args.input.firstName} ${args.input.lastName}`);
  });

const child = SafeFn.new(parent)
  .output(z.object({ message: z.string() }))
  .handler((args) => {
    return ok({
      message: `Hello ${args.ctx}`,
    });
  });
```

## `onStart()`

```ts
...
  .onStart(async (args) => {
    /*
    (parameter) args: {
        unsafeRawInput: {
            firstName: string;
            lastName: string;
        };
    */
  })
```

Starts execution right when you run your SafeFn and takes in the following parameters:

- `unsafeRawInput`: the raw input passed when running your SafeFn. Keep in mind this can contain additional properties when using one SafeFn as the parent of another!

## `onSuccess()`

```ts
...
  .onSuccess(async (args) => {
    /*
    (parameter) args: {
    input: {
        firstName: string;
        lastName: string;
    };
    unsafeRawInput: {
        firstName: string;
        lastName: string;
    }
   ctx: string;
    value: {
        message: string;
    };
    */
  })
```

Starts execution after output parsing has completed if you defined a schema, otherwise after your `handler()` or `safeHandler()` finished execution. Takes in the following parameters:

- `unsafeRawInput`: the raw input passed when running your SafeFn. Keep in mind this can contain additional properties when using one SafeFn as the parent of another!
- `input`: the results of parsing `unsafeRawInput` through your input schema if you defined one, otherwise `undefined`
- `ctx`: the `Ok` value of your parent safe-fn if you defined one, otherwise undefined.
- `ctxInput`: an array of all the parsed input of parent SafeFns.
- `value`: the `Ok` value of the safe-fn this callback is defined on.

## `onError()`

```ts
  .onError(async (args) => {
    /*
    (parameter) args: {
    asAction: boolean
    input: {
        firstName: string;
        lastName: string;
    } | undefined
    unsafeRawInput: {
        firstName: string;
        lastName: string;
    }
   ctx: string | undefined;
   error: {code: "INPUT_PARSING" ...} | ...
    */
  })
```

Starts execution after the first encountered `Err` return while executing your SafeFn. This can be anywhere between input parsing and output parsing. Takes in the following parameters:

- `asAction`: wether the safe-fn was run as an action (`createAction()()`) or not (`run()`). This can be helpful the narrow down the type of `error`.
- `unsafeRawInput`: the raw input passed when running your SafeFn. Keep in mind this can contain additional properties when using one SafeFn as the parent of another!
- `input`: the results of parsing `unsafeRawInput` through your input schema if you defined one and parsing was successful, otherwise `undefined`.
- `ctx`: the `Ok` value of your parent safe-fn if you defined one and execution was successful, otherwise undefined
- `ctxInput`: an array of all the parsed input of parent SafeFns. (Note this is not properly typed yet, the value of this depends on where your function errors)
- `error`: the `Err` error that caused your safe-fn to fail.

## `onComplete()`

```ts
...
  .onComplete(async (args) => {
    /*
    (parameter) args: {
    asAction: boolean
    input: {
        firstName: string;
        lastName: string;
    } | undefined
    unsafeRawInput: {
        firstName: string;
        lastName: string;
    }
   ctx: string | undefined;
   result: Result<string, {code: "INPUT_PARSING" ...} ...>
    */
  })
```

Starts execution after either `onSuccess()` or `onError()` is **called** (not finished). Takes in the following parameters:

- `asAction`: wether the safe-fn was run as an action (`createAction()()`) or not (`run()`). This can be helpful the narrow down the type of `error`.
- `unsafeRawInput`: the raw input passed when running your SafeFn. Keep in mind this can contain additional properties when using one SafeFn as the parent of another!
- `input`: the results of parsing `unsafeRawInput` through your input schema if you defined one and parsing was successful, otherwise `undefined`.
- `ctx`: the `Ok` value of your parent safe-fn if you defined one and execution was successful, otherwise undefined
- `ctxInput`: an array of all the parsed input of parent SafeFns. (Note this is not properly typed yet for the error case, the value of this depends on where your function errors)

- `result`: a `Result<T,E>` with either the `Ok` value of the safe-fn this callback was defined on if execution was successful, or the `Err` error.
