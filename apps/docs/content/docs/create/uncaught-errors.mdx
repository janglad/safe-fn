title: Handling errors
---

As this library is built around NeverThrow, ideally you should handle errors in your function and return them as values. However, some functions could throw unexpectedly.
To handle this you can provide you can provide an uncaught error handler via `catch()`, which receives the uncaught error as an argument and should return an `Err` value.

```ts
const mySafeFn = createSafeFn()
  .handler(() => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
      throw new Error();
    }
    return ok("Success");
  })
  .catch((e) => {
    //    ^? (parameter) e: unknown (not typed as Error as anything can be thrown in JS) // [!code highlight]
    return err("Ooh no!");
  });

const res = await mySafeFn.run();
//   ^? Result<"Success", "Ooh no!"> // [!code highlight]
```

  Next.js relies on throwing errors for `redirect()` and `notFound()`. These
  errors are filtered out and will still be thrown and thus not hit your catch
  handler.
</Callout>
<Callout type="info">

If you don't provide an uncaught error handler, the default error handler will be used:

```ts
(error: unknown) => {
  console.error(error);
  return err({
    code: "UNCAUGHT_ERROR",
    cause:
      "An uncaught error occurred. You can implement a custom error handler by using `catch()`",
  } as const);
};
```

</Callout>
